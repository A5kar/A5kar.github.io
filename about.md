I am a dedicated petroleum professional, with experience in FSU, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, thanks to multiple field assignments by the Italian major. Graduated in engineering and educated in management and energy economics, I am also a loving husband and father.

At the same time, I am also trying to catch up with the recent developments in information technology, in a bid to contribute to the digitalization of selected corporate practices, during this vigorous energy transition. To navigate through this journey without sinking, I enrolled in 2019 to [SDS MM](https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/) program offered by [edX](https://www.edx.org) and taught by [MIT](https://web.mit.edu) instructors.

Despite the initial excitement, due to work schedule I could start attending THE courses only in February 2020, right in the middle of the COVID-19 advent. So far, I completed four of the required courses and my resolutions for 2022 include succeeding the last piece of the program, that is the capstone exam.
